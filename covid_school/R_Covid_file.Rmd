## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
covid_data<-read_csv("data/SchoolOutbreaks_cleanedv2.csv") 
update <-read_csv("data/Update_Oct_27.csv")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

list_of_counties <- update %>%
  distinct(CountyReport) %>%
  arrange(CountyReport) %>%
  as_vector()
 
#list_of_counties <- list_of_counties[1]

for (county in list_of_counties) {
 # print(county)
  
  county_chart <- update %>%
    filter(CountyReport==county) %>%
    group_by(School) %>%
    summarize(
      count=n(),
      total_cases=sum(Number_of_Total_Cases)
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(total_cases)) %>%
    head(10) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(School,total_cases), weight=total_cases))+
    coord_flip() +
    labs(
      title= county,
      y = "Total Cases",
      x= "Schools"
    )  
  
  plot(county_chart)
    
}

```
